The Multifarmblock prevents you from farming with more than 2 chars at the same time.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How do I apply it?.

On the left side of your sidebar you have the point Multifarmblock.
If you click on the point in your sidebar, you can set which accounts should drop something from you.
Always remember. A maximum of 2 characters from 2 accounts can drop something at the same time.
However, you can still log in with more than one account. After the 3rd account you will get
a notification that it cannot drop anything anymore.
