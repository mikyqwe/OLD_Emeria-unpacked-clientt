[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. The start on Elendosfiles

In your beginning on Elendosfiles, you should take your time to discover what's new in our server and how to use basic features. 
Don't rush to level up, it's not a race! Also, make sure to walk around the city and explore the NPCs before 
you start your adventures in Elendosfiles... As a gift from us, You get a complete Equipment+9 and a Permanent Mount, 3days Pet,
A weapon costume for 3 days, 2x costume vouchers. That should make it really easy for you to get started.



[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2. What is the best way to level?

You will find that everything happens very quickly with us.
You should be able to ascend in your Empires to level 5+ and take up your teachings.
Then you can go directly to the neighbouring kingdom (Map 2).
Now comes the point that is very important. Always make sure that you see which dungeons you can master on Elendosfiles.
The beginner's Dungeon "Slime Cave", for example, is recommended from level 30 to 50.
You can find the Dungeons and Level maps on your minimap with the "T" button.
