[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1. First Week

The first week is about PvM. You should level up normally
and play normally. We will see if everything fits as it should.
If you find bugs or think that something is not right.
Please report them in our Discord server.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2. Second Week

The second week is about PvP. We want to see whether
the PVP system on the Elendosfiles is good or bad. We need your help!
You should do duels with all classes of characters and see
if it fits or not. Again, if you find something, please
report it in Discord.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2. Rewards for Beta Players

Every player who participates intensively in
the beta of Elendosfiles will receive a limited costume set at the end.
The exact set will be available on our Discord server.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3. Stay Fair

We want Elendosfiles to be a long-term project.
If you really find errors, report them. If it turns out
that errors are not reported and are exploited.
This person will be excluded from Elendosfiles and banned.
