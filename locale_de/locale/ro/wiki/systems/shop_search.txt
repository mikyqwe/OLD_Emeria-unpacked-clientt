The shop search allows you to filter all items from player shops on Elendosfiles.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How does the Shop Search work?


If you press F9, you will see a window open. This is exactly the Shop Search.
You can use the shop search on any Map1. Please make sure that you are on the same channel.
Here you can see different categories. You can simply search for a specific item
in the input field above or filter the items yourself by price.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. What do I have to consider?

The only thing you have to pay attention to is that you do not
constantly reload the pages. That can cause you problems.
