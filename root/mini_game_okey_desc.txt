Defeat monsters to earn cards. As soon as you've[ENTER]
collected and stacked together 10 Okey Cards, you'll[ENTER]
automatically receive an Okey Card Set and can play a[ENTER]
game. The aim of the game is to make combinations of sets[ENTER]
and runs.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
A set consists of three cards with the same number (e.g.[ENTER]
7, 7, 7). The lower the number on the cards, the fewer[ENTER]
points you'll earn for the set.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
A run consists of at least three consecutive cards (e.g.[ENTER]
6, 7, 8). The lower the number on the cards, the fewer[ENTER]
points you'll earn for the set. Runs in the same colour[ENTER]
will earn more points than multicoloured runs.[ENTER]
